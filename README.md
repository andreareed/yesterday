## Getting Started

A sample `common.env` file has been provided. Modify `common.template.env` to include your JWT secret and any other keys you'd like to use, and then rename the file to `common.env`.

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) - run `docker-compose up` and navigate to `https://localhost.com:3000` to see your app in the browser.
